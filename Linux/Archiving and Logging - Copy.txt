 
Week 5 Homework Submission File: Archiving and Logging Data
Please edit this file by adding the solution commands on the line below the prompt.
Save and submit the completed file for your homework submission.

Step 1: Create, Extract, Compress, and Manage tar Backup Archives
Command to extract the TarDocs.tar archive to the current directory:tar -xf TarDocs.tar


Command to create the Javaless_Doc.tar archive from the TarDocs/ directory, while excluding the TarDocs/Documents/Java directory:tar cvf Javaless_Docs.tar --exclude=”Java” TarDocs/


Command to ensure Java/ is not in the new Javaless_Docs.tar archive:tar tvf Javaless_Docs.tar | grep Java


Critical Analysis Question
Why wouldn't you use the options -x and -c at the same time with tar? They are conflictive functions  -c =creation -x =extraction

Step 2: Create, Manage, and Automate Cron Jobs
Cron job for backing up the /var/log/auth.log file:  0 06 * * 3 tar -czf /auth_backup.tgz /var/log/auth.log


Step 3: Write Basic Bash Scripts
Brace expansion command to create the four subdirectories: mkdir  ~/backups/{freemem,diskuse,openlist,freedisk}
Paste your system.sh script edits below:


#!/bin/bash
Chmod +x freemem_tool -h ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt    
Chmod +x  diskuse_ tool -h ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt.
Chmod +x openlist_tool -h ~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt.
Chmod +x freedisk_tool -h ~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt


Command to make the system.sh script executable: Chmod +x (file_name)


Optional
Commands to test the script and confirm its execution:

Step 4. Manage Log File Sizes
1.Run sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf to edit the logrotate configuration file.
